_Your seed phrase is the only way you (or anybody) can access your funds. Your seed phrase is not linked to your email or phone number. If you forget your wallet password or lose your device, the only way to restore your wallet is through your seed phrase!_


## Create New Wallet

The easiest way. After installation and clicking on the button “Create new wallet”, a user can skip the step about verifying seed by clicking on “I will do it later”. Take a look at the following screenshots.
