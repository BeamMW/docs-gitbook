# Beam Virtual Machine

Beam Virtual Machine (BVM) is a crucial building block in Beam Confidential DeFi platform. BVM follows the WebAssembly technology stack that allows Beam Shaders (smart contract running on Beam blockchain) to support any programming language compiled into WebAssembly, including C++ (currently supported), with Go and Rust to be added at a later date.
