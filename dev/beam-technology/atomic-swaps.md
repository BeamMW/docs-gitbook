# Atomic Swaps

Beam has built an Atomic Swap functionality that allows peer-to-peer trading of Beam for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, DOGE (and more) in a completely decentralized way without an exchange or any other 3rd party intermediary. Atomic Swaps are the pinnacle of decentralization, censorship resistance, and core values of cryptocurrencies.

â€ŒWe built this functionality directly into Beam Desktop Wallets, including Atomic Swap Marketplace, allowing users to publish and accept swap offers.

See [Atomic Swaps design](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/Atomic-swap) or [Atomic Swap token format](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/Atomic-swap-token) for more detailed information regarding Atomic Swaps.
