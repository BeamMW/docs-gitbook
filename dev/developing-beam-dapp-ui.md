# Developing Beam DApp UI

Most of Beam Decentralized Applications include a front end component which can run within the Beam Wallet or as a standalone website that connects to Beam Web Wallet.

These front end components are usually implemented using standard Web Frameworks such as React or Vue (or any other). The communication with the smart contract that is deployed on chain is handled through the Application Shader, which is provided as a Web Assembly component embedded within the web application.

In this tutorial we will review how to set up the development environment for building Beam DApps using the Desktop Wallet

### Configure the 'testapp' in the wallet

1. Download and install [Beam Desktop wallet](https://beam.mw/downloads/dappnet)\
   \
   We recommend using DAPPNET (the testing network created especially for testing dapps), as it is the most convenient for this purpose. You will also need to get some DAPPNET Beam to pay transaction fees, which can be done using the Faucet application you can find in the built in DApp Store.\

2. Find the location of your Beam Wallet data folder\
   \
   In the settings screen of the wallet, open the 'Troubleshooting' section. It will show you the location of your wallet folder on your platform

3\. Open the folder and locate the settings.ini file

Edit the file and add the following section:

```
[devapp]
name=testapp
url=http://127.0.0.1:13666/index.html
```

Restart the Desktop Wallet. Now in the DApp Store screen you will see the placeholder for the test app.

### Running the application

For this section we assume that contract is already deployed on the blockchain and that application shader assembly is present. As an example we will use the BANS application that can be seen here: [https://github.com/BeamMW/bans](https://github.com/BeamMW/bans)

In order to run this application you will need the following pre-requisutes:

1. [nodejs ](https://nodejs.org/en/)for your platform
2. yarn (can be installed with 'npm install --global yarn', once you install nodejs)

Now change directory to where you have cloned the BANS repository and run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

If any questions are asked during installation just chose default answers this should work.

Once the local development server is running, you can launch the 'testapp' in the wallet. This will show you the BANS screen

### Using the Developer Console

During application development, it is useful to be able to see the developer console, as you would in a regular browser. Beam Desktop Wallet provides this option when launched with a flag:

```
--remote-debugging-port=20000
```

After you relaunch the wallet with this flag, you can open a regular web browser and navigate to: [http://localhost:20000/](http://localhost:20000/)

### Packaging into .dapp file

In order to distribute the application as a stand alone archive in should be packaged into a .dapp file

This can be done following the steps below:

1. Create the following folder structure

 - Create an empty folder, use your dapp name for simplicity
 - Inside this folder create another empty folder called 'app'


2. Build your application

Run ```yarn build``` 
This will create an `html` folder (if you are using the React template as provided by beam here (https://github.com/BeamMW/beam-dapp-react)
Copy the contents of the build folder (in our case 'html') into the app folder created in step 1. 

3. Create manifest file

The manifest file contains the required metadata for your application that will be parsed and presented by the Beam Wallet during dApp installation.

```
{
   "name":  "",   //required, max length 30 characters
   "description":  "", //required, max length 1024 characters
   "url":  "localapp/app/index.html", //required
   "version":  "1.1.17", //required
   "api_version":  "7.0", //required, max length 10 characters 
   "min_api_version":  "7.0", //required, max length 10 characters
   "icon":  "localapp/app/logo.svg", //required, max size 10240 byte. SVG files only
   "guid":  "d353352eb6a94618ac0a8ec7b29ca7bb" //required
}
```

This file should be called *manifest.json* and copied into the same folder as the 'app' folder created above

>TIP: To generate the guid you can use online GUID generators like: https://www.guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx 
>Just remember to remove the checkbox from the 'hiphens' option

4. Zip the top application folder (the one that has the manifest and the 'app' folder inside of it into a .zip archive
5. Rename the .zip file to .dapp

You can now test the local installation by using the 'Install DApp from file' option in the Desktop Wallet DApp Store
