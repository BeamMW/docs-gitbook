# Beam to Ethereum Bridge

## New Horizons for Interoperability

Beam Bridge connects Beam’s private DeFi (PriFi) to Ethereum’s vast DeFi and Token ecosystems. Currently, supported assets include ETH, DAI, WBTC, and USDT. When bridging assets over from Ethereum, tokens are locked with an Ethereum Smart contract and minted on the Beam blockchain as wrapped Confidential Assets (CAs).

Currently, Beam Bridge allows users to bridge back their own tokens only, meaning that a user can only send back to Ethereum up to the same amount they initially bridged into Beam (for example, if a user sent 1 ETH via the Beam bridge, then they can only claim up to 1 ETH when moving back to Ethereum). This may change in the future as the team enhances the Bridge features by improving locked liquidity mechanisms, cross-chain privacy, and more.

## Get started with Beam Bridge: Step-by-Step Tutorial

Users will need the following:

* [**MetaMask wallet**](https://metamask.io/)
* [**Beam Wallet**](https://beam.mw/en/downloads)

MetaMask is required for storing and transferring crypto assets on the Ethereum blockchain.
Beam Wallet is required to store crypto assets on the Beam blockchain.
