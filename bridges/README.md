# The Beam Bridge

## New Horizons for Interoperability

Beam Bridge connects Beam’s **Private DeFi (PriFi)** to Ethereum’s vast DeFi ecosystem. **Supported assets include ETH, DAI, WBTC, and USDT**. When bridging assets over from Ethereum, tokens are locked inside an Ethereum Smart contract and minted on the Beam blockchain as wrapped Confidential Assets (CAs).

**Note: Beam Bridge currently allows users to bridge back their own tokens. i.e. a user can only send back to Ethereum up to the same amount they initially bridged into Beam. For example, if a user sent 1 ETH via the Beam bridge, then they can only claim up to 1 ETH when moving back to Ethereum. This is subject to change, as the Bridge continues to improve through locked liquidity mechanisms, cross-chain privacy, and more.**

## Get started with Beam Bridge: Step-by-Step Tutorial

Users will need the following:

* [**MetaMask wallet**](https://metamask.io/)
* [**Beam Wallet**](https://beam.mw/downloads)

MetaMask is required for storing and transferring crypto assets on the Ethereum blockchain.
Beam Wallet is required to store crypto assets on the Beam blockchain.
