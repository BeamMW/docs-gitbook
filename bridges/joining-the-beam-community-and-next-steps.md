# Joining the Beam community and Next Steps

## Whats next?

The Beam Team is rigorously testing the Beam Bridge on the Testnet before its upcoming Mainnet release. The Bridge brings much-needed cross-chain scalability and liquidity to Beam and can act as a privacy conduit for public blockchains. In the future, more tokens will be supported for cross-chain transfers, including the ability to move non-fungible tokens (NFTs) across blockchains. Stay Tuned!
