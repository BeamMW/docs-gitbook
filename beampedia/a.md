## Account

Similar to what is commonly referred to as a [wallet](/docs/beampedia/w#wallet). In [Beam](/docs/beampedia/b#beam) it is a private account owned and operated by the user.

An account contains all of the user transaction accounting history, as well as the resulting current total balance.

A Beam account is [self-sovereign](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2018/06/self-sovereign-identity-why-blockchain/), which means that only the users can access and control their balance and that the full responsibility rests on them. The account is usually stored in the user's computer.

This is achieved with public key cryptography, which has two separate keys: a public and a private key. The public key can be shared, and it can be used by the user to view the balance without any security risks. The private key must be stored securely, and only used when signing a transaction.

## Address

An address is an identifier that represents a possible destination for a payment. Addresses can be generated at no cost by any user. Like e-mail addresses, one can send a transaction to a person by sending to one of their addresses. However, unlike e-mail addresses, people may have different addresses and a unique address should be used for each transaction.

A [Beam](/docs/beampedia/b#beam) address is derived from a public key through the use of a cryptographic hash function. Addresses in Beam are longer than in most cryptocurrencies, as it uses Confidential Transactions (CT), which need to include an additional public key in the address to encrypt a message to the receiver. This message includes information about the amount being transferred.

## Architecture

Computer Architecture is the science and art of selecting and interconnecting software and hardware components to create computers that meet functional, performance and cost goals.

A common problem in computer architecture is coping with complexity. Much of it resulting from the need to increase the performance and scale of the computer system while meeting design goals and requirements.

The design goals of computer architecture are very often:

- Low cost
- Low energy  
- Functionality
- Reliability
- Performance

Technology is constantly changing, mostly due to Moore’s Law which stipulates an exponential rate of transistor miniaturization. Often an improvement crosses a possibility threshold, which permits new applications that become its own self-sustaining market, such as smartphones.

Sometimes the improvement comes as a technological disruption, such as the transistor, microprocessors, multicore systems, and flash-based solid-state storage. Disruptions are necessary for scaling systems which can’t continue scaling forever. Software disruptions in the form of new algorithms, such as public key cryptography, enabled the scaling of cryptosystems for the internet age.

## Atomic Swaps

Atomic swaps are the process of exchanging two different cryptocurrencies from separate blockchains in a trust-less and decentralized manner. This operation is based on scripts, and it allows users to trade their coins directly from their own personal crypto wallets.

The biggest advantages of atomic swaps are in its decentralized nature. By removing the need for a centralized exchange or any other kind of mediator, cross-chain swaps can be executed by two (or more) parties without requiring them to trust each other. There is also an increased level of security because users retain full access and ownership of their funds unlike transacting through centralized exchange or third party. This form of peer to peer trading has much lower operational costs as trading fees are either very low or absent. Lastly, an enhanced level of anonymity is secured when atomic swapping privacy coins like Beam without an intermediary.
