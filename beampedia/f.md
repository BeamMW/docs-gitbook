## Financing

The process of providing funds for business activities, making purchases or investing. In traditional financing, there are two main types of funding: debt and equity. Debt is a loan that must be paid back, often with interest. Equity gives ownership stakes in the company to the shareholder. Financing takes advantage of the fact that some have a surplus of money that they wish to put to work, while others demand money to undertake investment.

Cryptocurrency has provided a new venue for financing, as blockchain-based ventures raise capital by selling cryptographically secure digital assets (tokens). This can be in the form of a general-purpose medium of exchange and store-of-value cryptocurrency, a token which represents conventional security (security token), or a token which represent a right to a service provided in the network (utility token).

Utility tokens leverage the value of the network and the market demand of the token itself. This decouples the ownership of tokens from equity in the venture, and (theoretically) puts the incentive in the long-term development of the platform. However, utility tokens have found very short-term success, and their regulatory uncertainty was a breeding ground for frauds. The market has thus shifted to slower, regulated security tokens offerings.

Financing in Beam can be achieved with Confidential Assets, which allow the issuance of custom assets, such as tokens. This not only preserves the privacy of the issuer, but also the privacy of the issued token which is known only to the involved parties.

## FOMO

Acronym for “fear of missing out.” The social anxiety over missing out on something important. The fear is tied to regret and imagined possibilities, exacerbated by social media.
This is a subject for behavioral economics, which studies the effects of psychological, cognitive, emotional, cultural and social factors on the economic decisions of individuals and institutions. Behavioral economics often contradict the classical economic theory, which developed under the assumption that human beings are perfectly rational agents.

Dan Ariely, Professor of behavioral economics at Duke University, explained that FOMO is caused by anticipation of regret, as we compare our present state on what “we could have been.” This is called “reference dependence,” as defined by Daniel Kahneman, (winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize in economics) in his 1979 book Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk.

## Fungibility

In economics, fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are essentially interchangeable, as fungibility implies equal value between the assets. Fungibility refers only to the equivalence of each unit of a commodity with other units of the same commodity and not to the exchange of one commodity for another, which is barter.

Currency is fungible: one banknote is interchangeable with any other banknote like it. Gold of the same grade and weight is fungible. On the other hand diamonds are considered unique and are not perfectly fungible, variations make it difficult to find several diamonds expected to have the same value. Fungibility does not imply liquidity, and vice versa. Diamonds trading is liquid, yet individual diamonds are not interchangeable.

In cryptocurrencies, privacy is essentially tied to fungibility. Cryptocurrencies with a public ledger such as Bitcoin often lose fungibility, as some coins are treated as more acceptable than others. Coins involved in questionable transactions can taint entire wallets since values are merged. Tainted coins can be accepted without knowledge, or can even be sent into an unknowing account, resulting in a loss of reputation.
