## Hash

One way hash functions, also called fingerprints or cryptographically secure checksums. A one-way function is one which is easy to compute but difficult (effectively impossible) to invert. The hash function maps data of arbitrary size into a string of fixed size, using a one-way compression function.

Ideally, a cryptographic hash function should be:

- deterministic, the same message always results in the same hash
- quick to compute
- infeasible to generate a message from its hash
- a small change to a message should change the hash value completely, so no correlations could be inferred
- infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash value (collision)

The most common hash algorithms are MD5 (message-digest 5), which has been deprecated for SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm), also phased out to SHA-2 and SHA-3. The algorithms above use the Merkle–Damgård construction, while SHA-3 uses Keccak ([sponge construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge_function)). The newer BLAKE algorithm is based on ChaCha stream cipher. BLAKE is a faster algorithm when run on 64-bit and ARM architectures, used in the Equihash proof-of-work algorithm, and as a key derivation function.

## Hold

A passive investment strategy, also called “buy and hold,” for which the investor buys a cryptocurrency asset and holds it for a long period of time regardless of fluctuations in the market. In the case of high volatility markets such as cryptocurrency.

The first use of the term dates back to December 2013, in a bitcointalk post titled “[I AM HODLING](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.msg4022997#msg4022997)” by Sr. Member GameKyuubi after (in his own words) had some whiskey.

GameKyuubi’s reasoning was that in extremely volatile markets, at a zero-sum game such as trading, inexperienced traders often lose to more seasoned investors and should focus instead on long term investments. In his own words: “You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob. The people in between (sic) hold. In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.”

In the case of pump and dump schemes, often seen in cryptocurrencies of small market cap, the advice can be malicious, as investors attempt to exit the market before those who are piously holding an asset which is rapidly becoming worthless.

The aim of cryptocurrencies is to become a self-sovereign store of value, not necessarily a financial investment. Many cryptocurrency evangelists hope for their currencies to appreciate due to the devaluation of fiat government-backed currencies into hyperinflation, eventually transacting exclusively in cryptocurrency. Holding advice is thus never to exchange cryptocurrency into fiat-based currencies, and never spending cryptocurrencies until their ultimate global adoption.
