## Lambo

Abbreviation of Lamborghini, an Italian brand and manufacturer of luxury sports cars, SUVs, and tractors. The cars are some of the most sought-after sports cars in the world, is among the fastest and most expensive. The abbreviation seldom includes Lamborghini’s tractor line, noted for their high-performance hydraulic pump system and customizable transmission configuration.

Due to the consonant digraph in the name (“gh”), unfamiliar to non-Italian speakers, the abbreviation has spared many of typing errors, universally accepted as the most revealing sign of low IQ on internet social media, even in informal conversations.

It is often used as a comparative measurement of value decoupled from national currencies. At the 2017’s all-time high (ATH), one bitcoin was worth 1/20th of a Lamborghini Aventador. It is helpful for comprehension as a desirable, tangible asset, unlike wealth “on paper” when stated in terms of fiat currency.

The simile illustrates the rapid value increase of cryptocurrencies since on May 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz paid a Bitcoin Talk user 10,000 BTC for two Papa John’s pizzas, regarded as the first tangible purchase with a cryptocurrency.

“When Lambo?” is the interrogative equivalent to the phrase “To the Moon!” in internet social media. Sometimes combined as “Lambos on The Moon,” not accounting for shipping expenses, Lamborghinis’ low ground clearance ineffective on cratered surfaces, stiff suspension for low gravity, or the absence of atmospheric oxygen required for the operation of a combustion engine.

Purchasing a high-end sports car with cryptocurrency revenues should proceed after careful compliance with tax regulation, as government agencies are prone to inquire about luxurious concessions, particularly if someone is unemployed.

## Lelantus

Beam has implemented several improvements to the original Mimblewimble protocol to obfuscate the transaction graph. A hybrid of MW and Lelantus is bring introduced now, which should be a huge step forward in this direction.

Disclaimer:
The Lelantus protocol is the work of Zcoin's cryptographer Aram Jivanyan as part of their research to improve their privacy protocol. To fit our needs and utilize the full power of MW we made several modifications to the original protocol.

Lelantus uses standard cryptographic assumptions and allows the creation of a shielded UTXOs pool with strong anonymity. It also does not require any trusted setup. Lelantus-MW will dramatically increase the UTXO anonymity set and make it virtually impossible to establish links between different UTXOs. On top of that, Lelantus transactions will provide one-sided payments which allows for sending and receiving Beam without Mimblewimble’s interactivity requirement.
