# Beam Hash III

Similar to most cryptocurrencies, Beam relies on [miners](/beampedia-item/mining) to add transactions to the blockchain. While all nodes in the Beam network confirm the validity of transactions, Beam counts on miners to take on the massive heavy lifting in securing the Beam network.â€Œ

The Beam network is secured using [Beam Hash III](https://docs.beam.mw/beamHash\_III\_spec.pdf) (a modified version of [Equihash](/beampedia-item/equihash)), which miners utilize in a decentralized method using proof-of-work. [Beam Hash III](https://docs.beam.mw/beamHash\_III\_spec.pdf) allows anyone with the appropriate hardware to mine Beam, whether by mining pool or a solo mining method.

[Beam Hash III](https://docs.beam.mw/beamHash\_III\_spec.pdf) (preceded by the aptly named BeamHash and BeamHashII) is the third and final algorithmic evolution by Wilke Trei, creator of the popular mining software [_lolMiner_](https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Beam Hash III requires a graphics card with a minimum 3GB of memory.**

Both NVIDIA and AMD are compatible. Experienced miners will have a full solo mining rig setup; however, joining a Beam mining pool with a single GPU with at least 3GB of memory is feasible.

See our [mining pool](pool-mining-beam.md) or [solo mining](solo-mining-beam.md) guides to get started mining Beam!
