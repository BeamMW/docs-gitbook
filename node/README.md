The Beam Node is an essential part of the Beam network. Each node forms the peer-to-peer network that validates transactions and blocks on the blockchain. The Beam Node can run on Linux, Mac, and Windows operating systems.

The Beam Node offers users two modes: Mining and Validating. Each Mode is an essential but very straightforward component of the Beam network.

Nodes set to "mining mode" mine Beam, validate transactions, add blocks to the Beam blockchain. In comparison, Nodes set to "validating mode" act as a complete record of the Beam blockchain. Each node "validates" new blocks added to the blockchain to maintain the integrity of the Beam network.
