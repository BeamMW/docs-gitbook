# Validating Mode

By default, the Beam Node operates as "validating mode," meaning mining is disabled. For more information on Beam mining and how-to Mine Beam, see our Beam Mining Guide.

Nodes set in "Validating mode" perform a critical component to the overall health and safety of the Beam network by:

* Assisting the flow of transactions and blocks through the Beam network.
* Enables wallet-to-wallet communication by broadcasting SBBS messages.
* Functions as Dandelion Stem relays to improve P2P level security.

Support the Beam network by running a local node!
