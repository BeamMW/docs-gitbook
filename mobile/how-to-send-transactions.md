# Sending Beam

While your Beam mobile wallet puts users in complete control over their digital funds, however recovering funds sent or received by an incorrect address is not possible. Always double-check to make sure you are not sending Beam coins to an incorrect or expired address.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Transaction Fees**

Offline transactions (regular Offline and Public Offline) have significantly higher transaction fees than regular transactions due to the more significant blockchain requirements Offline payments have compared to Regular. **Max anonymity set carries the same fees as Offline**.

* **Regular transaction**: Fee = 0.001 Beam (Before HF-3 100 GROTH).
* **Offline transaction**: Fee = 0.011 BEAM (0.01-for shielded coin + 0.001-fee transaction).
{% endhint %}

## To Send Beam

{% hint style="danger" %}

{% endhint %}

1. **Launch** Beam mobile wallet app.
2. From the wallet screen, tap **send**.

## How it looks in your wallet

### Regular and Offline transactions

{% hint style="info" %}
**Regular/Offline addresses differ from Public Offline address**.

1. **Regular/Offline addresses have a default expiration date of 24 hours**.\
   For maximum privacy, we strongly recommend you generate a new address for every transaction. To edit your address expiration date, see this [page](address.md).
2. **Offline addresses can only be sent once**.\
   Once generated, the Offline address is only good for single payment.
3. **Your Public Offline address will never expire**.\
   We strongly recommend your Public Offline address be used if you accept regular donations. It will be possible to trace your information from a Public Offline address. To find your Public Offline address, see this [page](hot-to-generate-address.md#public-offline-address).
{% endhint %}

The sender decides whether to send a Regular payment or an Offline payment.
