# Receiving Beam

## To Receive Beam

1. **Launch** Beam mobile wallet app.
2. From the wallet screen, tap **receive**.
3. **Copy**<img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-07-14 at 10.22.49 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line">**your wallet address**. If the Sender uses Beam mobile, tap<img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-07-01 at 9.38.55 PM (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">to access your wallet address's shareable QR code. The Sender will decide between Regular and Offline payments. **To send an address with higher privacy settings,** **Advanced > Maximum anonymity set**.
4. Enter a requested amount (optional).&#x20;
5. Leave a comment (optional). Comments are only visible inside your wallet for personal record-keeping.&#x20;
6. To complete your transaction, tap **share address** to airdrop your wallet address or send via a secure messaging app.

## How it looks in your wallet

### Receive screen

Tapping on receive automatically generates a new address. Each new address has a default expiration time of 24 hours, (to change address expiration times, see [Address](address.md#edit-an-address)).

### Sharing your address

### Regular wallet address & Offline wallet address

To share your wallet address for a Regular transaction, simply copy/paste your wallet address and share your wallet address over a secure messaging app. If the sender is on mobile, tap<img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-07-01 at 9.38.55 PM (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">to access your wallet address's shareable QR code.&#x20;

Offline payments are sent to your Beam wallet via [SBBS address](settings.md#utilities)**.** Tap "address details" to find your SBBS address.

### Maximum anonymity set

The max anonymity set is a unique Offline transaction that offers maximum privacy. It can take up to 72 hours to complete; users can adjust the [lock times](http://mobile-wallet-user-guide/settings#privacy) in their mobile wallets. However, shorter lock times equals less privacy; the highest lock time guarantees your private information remains confidential.  &#x20;

### Public Offline address

We recommend Public Offline addresses for users expecting to receive regular Offline payments. Public Offline addresses do not expire. While having a single lifetime address can sound appealing, we cannot guarantee maximum privacy for your personal information (transaction history, wallet balance).&#x20;

To find your Public Offline address:

1. Tap <img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-07-01 at 9.19.58 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line"> to access your **wallet menu**.&#x20;
2. Go to **Settings** <img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-07-01 at 9.17.22 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line"> **> utilities > "show public offline address."**
3. **Copy address** or allow the sender to scan your QR code.

#### Show Public Offline Address
