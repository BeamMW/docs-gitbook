# Proof Of Transaction

Since Beam 2.0., the receiver wallet has automatically signed proof of received transaction before sending it to the sender. Proof of transaction is only available for transactions whose status reads as "sent" and is not available for transactions with different transaction statuses, e.g. "expired," "failed," "completed," "received." 

## Verifying proof of transaction

### As the Sender

1. **Launch** Beam mobile wallet.
2. From the wallet screen, **transactions > "sent transaction" > "payment proof."**
3. **Copy**<img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-07-14 at 10.22.49 PM (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">the payment proof (tap **details**<img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-07-14 at 10.56.34 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line">to view the full payment proof).
4. **Send the code** to the receiver via a secure messaging app.
