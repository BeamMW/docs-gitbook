Starting from version 5.0 we separated core beam library project and its UI.

Desktop UI is a separte git repostotry now [https://github.com/BeamMW/beam-ui](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam-ui).

For earlier versions, build instructions are located [here](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/How-to-build(old)).

# Before build

1. Ensure that you have `git` installed
1. `beam-ui` and `beam` project use `CMake` to generate build environment. The minimal supported version of `CMake` is **3.13** 
1. Download and install `boost` library. The minimal supported version is 1.66
1. Download and install `OpenSSL` library

# Common part

1. Clone Beam sources before building  
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/BeamMW/beam.git
    ```  

1. Beam has submodules 
    ```
    cd beam
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

## Branch convention
1. We use `master` branch for development.
1. To be able to connect to `testnet` you have to checkout `testnet` branch
1. To be able to connect to `mainnet` you have to checkout `mainnet` branch


## CMake options
Beam uses CMake to generate a build. Beam has several options to say how to build the project, which feature to turn ON/OFF. T
Please, look reference to root `CMakeLists.txt` file.

# Windows
1. Install Visual Studio >= 2017 with CMake support.
1. Download and install Boost prebuilt binaries https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.75.0/boost_1_75_0-msvc-14.1-64.exe, also add `BOOST_ROOT` to the _Environment Variables_.
1. Download and install OpenSSL prebuilt binaries https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html (`Win64 OpenSSL v1.1.0h` for example) and add `OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR` to the _Environment Variables_.
1. Add `.../boost_1_75_0/lib64-msvc-14.1` to the _System Path_.
1. Open project folder in Visual Studio, select your target (`Release-x64` for example, if you downloaded 64bit Boost and OpenSSL) and select `CMake -> Build All`.
1. Open cache folder
   ```
   Visual Studio 2017:
   Go to CMake -> Cache -> Open Cache Folder -> beam

   Visual Studio 2019:
   Project -> CMake Cache -> Open in Explorer

   You'll find binaries in beam/..., wallet/cli/..., explorer/... subfolders.
   ```

# Linux 

**Please read carefully the points below**

**1.** After finishing your build you'll find the the `beam-node` binary (node) in the `beam/beam` folder, `beam-wallet` (cli wallet) in the `beam/wallet/cli` folder.

**2.** You need to clone beam sources before building
```
git clone https://github.com/BeamMW/beam.git
```
The command above checks out the latest master branch where all the development happens. Usually it is not what you want to build. Choose an appropriate branch [here](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/branches) and check out it after you have the main repository cloned. For example the command below checks out the Double Doppler 4.0 release branch
```
cd beam
git checkout double_doppler_4.0RC
```

**3.** By default instructions produce masternet builds (development version, development blockchain). To be able to build testnet (testing) or mainnet (real-world blockchain) you need to edit the `beam/CMakeLists.txt` file lines 151-157. Uncomment (remove the '#' sign) respective definitions.
```
# uncomment next line for testnet
#set(BEAM_TESTNET TRUE)
# uncomment next line for mainnet
#set(BEAM_MAINNET TRUE)

# uncomment next line for swap mainnet
#set(SWAP_MAINNET TRUE)
```
