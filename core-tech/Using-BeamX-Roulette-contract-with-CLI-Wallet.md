Let's play some games!

In this example we will interact with the contract that 

As usual we assume that you have read [BeamX Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/BeamX-Getting-Started) and [Using BeamX Faucet contract with CLI Wallet](https://github.com/BeamMW/beam/wiki/Using-BeamX-Faucet-contract-with-CLI-Wallet)

We also assume that you have the app.wasm and contract.was in the shaders/roulette folder under the 'beamx' folder where you keep your wallet binary file.

If so, we are all set to spin our Roulette.

Well, it's a kind of roulette. In our case your bet is on any number between 0 and 36 (including both 0 and 36). If you guess the number exactly you receive 100 tokens (which are actually new confidential assets on Beam chain). This actually means that in order to create a new Roulette contract you would need to lock the new asset type deposit (which in this chain is configured to be 1000 Beam)

1. How do I play?

Since Roulette contract has an implicit owner (who is the dealer) there could be many roulettes out there. To find all of them we will run the following command:

`beam-wallet-beamx.exe shader --shader_app_file shaders\roulette\app.wasm --shader_args="role=player,action=bet,cid=ac16be1cb673ace9423d32fe20893e1639fd560e35e6b3433c77bee831647372,iSector=15" -n 127.0.0.1:8501`

To check the status of your bet run

`beam-wallet-beamx.exe shader --shader_app_file shaders\roulette\app.wasm --shader_args="role=player,action=check,cid=ac16be1cb673ace9423d32fe20893e1639fd560e35e6b3433c77bee831647372" -n 127.0.0.1:8501`

To get your winning run:

`beam-wallet-beamx.exe shader --shader_app_file shaders\roulette\app.wasm --shader_args="role=player,action=take,cid=ac16be1cb673ace9423d32fe20893e1639fd560e35e6b3433c77bee831647372" -n 127.0.0.1:8501`
