# Electrum Atomic Swaps Configuration

## Connect with Electrum Wallet

If you have an Electrum wallet, connecting to a remote node follows a similar yet more straightforward process:

### Edit Electrum Wallet Settings

2. Enter your Electrum address.
3. Enter an existing seed phrase or generate a new one (you can change wallets at any time).

Once connected, you should be able to see the list of all wallet addresses in your Electrum wallet by clicking "Show wallet addresses."
