# Files and Locations

## Things to Consider:

* Windows users can change the default location of their Desktop Wallet App during the installation process.
* Windows users can also change the default database location of their Desktop Wallet by setting the AppData parameter to `beam-wallet.cfg`
* "Memory dump" files are generated each time your wallet crashes (Windows only).
* Each wallet version keeps the `wallet.db` file in a dedicated sub-folder designated by the wallet version number. During every wallet update, a new folder copies the old `wallet.db` file from the previous version to the new.
