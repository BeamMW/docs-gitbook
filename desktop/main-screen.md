#### Maximum anonymity set

Max privacy transactions can take up to 72 hours to complete (the longer your assets remain in the maximum anonymity set, the higher the security for the transaction).&#x20;

### Transaction History and Statuses

Each sent or received transaction will be recorded in your Beam wallet transactions list. In addition, each transaction will include the following information:

* **Coin**: the name of the cryptocurrency (or asset) received.
* **Amount**: the number of coins sent or received.
* **USD or BTC Value**: the transaction value the day of trade.
* **Created On**: the date on which the cryptocurrency was sent or received.
* **Status**: the current state of the transaction (in progress, sent, received).

Clicking on the Beam or Assets displayed in your wallet balance will filter your transactions list to only display transactions for that particular currency.
