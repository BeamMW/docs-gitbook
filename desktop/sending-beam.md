# Sending Beam

As you have probably noticed by now, Beam transactions work slightly differently than other cryptocurrencies. However, the sleek and minimalist Beam wallet UI (available on desktop and mobile), makes sending and receiving different payments a breeze.&#x20;

Each payment, e.g.,[ transaction type](https://app.gitbook.com/@beamx/s/desktop-wallet-user-guide/\~/drafts/-McGeEd59nhcQ7IuTcTQ/receiving-beam#transaction-types) incurs different fees and utilizes different addresses. Be sure to understand the differences before sending out your Beam coins!

{% hint style="info" %}
**Transaction fees**

Offline transactions (Regular Public Offline) have significantly higher transaction fees than Regular transactions due to the more significant blockchain requirements Offline payments have compared to regular.

* **Regular transaction**: Fee = 0.001 Beam (Before HF-3 100 GROTH).&#x20;
* **Offline transaction**: Fee = 0.011 BEAM (0.01-for shielded coin + 0.001-fee transaction).
* **Max Privacy Transaction**: Minimum transaction fee for Max Privacy transactions is \~ 0.01 Beam (Shielded coin fee = 0.01 + 0.001 (fee transaction) = 0.011 BEAM).
