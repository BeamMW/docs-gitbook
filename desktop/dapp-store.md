## Beams Anonymous Naming Service (BANS)

The Beam Anonymous Naming Service or BANS is the latest offering from the Beam development team. BANS is a smart contract that simplifies sending and receiving assets while providing all the privacy and security of a regular Beam address.

BANS domains link to Beam wallets and bypass the traditional way of sending and receiving cryptocurrency (via a long alpha-numeric string of characters) by allowing users to send (and receive) assets to a simple domain name built on the Beam blockchain.

Users can register, sell, and gift BANS domains in just a few clicks. Users can purchase as many BANS domains as they wish. Note: BANS DApp is currently only available on desktop wallets, and the DAppnet

### Registering a BANS domain

1. Launch **Beam Desktop wallet** <img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-07-31 at 8.29.33 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line">.
2. **Open BANS DApp** ![](<.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-08-09 at 7.49.05 PM.png>).
3. Search for the BANS domain you wish to register.
4. **Choose your desired registration period** (minimum one year). Review the gas and registration fees.
5. &#x20;Click **confirm** to complete your BANS domain registration.
6. Registered BANS domains will be listed under **My domains** ![](<.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-08-09 at 7.51.10 PM.png>) in the BANS DApp.
