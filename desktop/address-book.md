# Address Book

{% hint style="danger" %}
Beam addresses are only stored locally in the wallet database and not on the blockchain. Be sure to backup or export the wallet metadata before removing the wallet.
{% endhint %}

## Address Book

Your **Address Book**<img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-07-03 at 5.07.56 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line">is where you will find:

* **My Active Addresses**: active wallet addresses are secure and ready to send or receive Beam coins.&#x20;
* **My Expired Addresses**: expired wallet addresses from previous transactions.
* **Contacts Lists**: a helpful list of previously sent wallet addresses.&#x20;

## **How it looks in your wallet**

### **'My Active' addresses**

Remember: the wallet address data listed in transactions or address book does not reflect the address data stored on the blockchain.

Your wallet address data is stored locally in your `wallet.db` file. To find your `wallet.db` file, see [files and locations](files-and-locations/).

### 'My Expired' addresses

Addresses expire after every sent transaction and become inactive. Conversely, you can receive payments with the same address a total of 10 times. Desktop wallet addresses have a default expiration date of two months.

Always double-check that you are not using an expired address to receive or send your Beam coins.

Delete previously sent to wallet addresses or send them more Beam by clicking the **kebab menu**<img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-07-14 at 5.19.47 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line"> &#x20;

### 'Edit address'

Clicking the **kebab menu**<img src=".gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-07-14 at 5.19.47 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line">allows you to access the 'edit address' function:

* **Receive**: receive more Beam coins from a previously used active address.
* **Show QR Code**: users sending Beam using the mobile wallet app can scan the QR code for fast, secure payments.
* **Edit Address**: write and save comments for your record-keeping.
* **Delete Address**: deleting an address on your desktop wallet also deletes it from your `wallet.db` file.

The data of the addresses listed in your Beam wallet address book is stored locally and does not reflect data recorded on the blockchain.
