# Groovy Gluon 7.0.13064

<sub>Thursday, June 2, 2022</sub>

#### TL;DR Release Highlights

- The hard fork will take place at block 1,820,000. To continue using your funds, please upgrade your wallets prior to reaching the height!
- Numerous infrastructure improvements so that BEAM wallet (and Dapps in particular) work even more seamlessly and intuitively than before (20+ tasks in total - see in details [here](#)).

#### Improvements

Plentiful user-oriented improvements have been implemented, including:

- Clearer notifications/errors/confirmations for users, so you won't miss anything.
- Implemented IPFS integration. Support [Documentation](#).
- Added support of HFTx (High-frequency transactions).
- Ability to recover a web wallet from a mobile recovery file.
- Wallet API users can now sign user messages correctly.

#### Known Limitations

- When using active laser beam channels, the CLI wallet should not be offline for over 24 hours.
- Once generated, do not offer the same offline address to multiple senders of payments.

#### Points to Mention

- Upon using Atomic Swaps with ETH, DAI, WBTC, and USDT, users will have to create an account on Infura.
- The sender of funds to a receiver's Public Offline Address might be able to know that those funds are later being used by the receiver. Beam wallet and Beam explorer do not expose such functionality, but it's possible to derive this information by analyzing the Blockchain.
