# Fierce Fermion 6.2.12491

<sub>Thursday, December 16, 2021</sub>

#### TL;DR Release Highlights

- Numerous infrastructure improvements so that BEAM wallet (and Dapps in particular) work even more seamlessly and intuitively than before (30+ tasks in total - see in details [here](#) and [here](#)).

#### Improvements

- Dapps transaction notification shows a progress bar now.
- Dapp transactions include information about the exact action you were paying or receiving the money for.
- Dapps screen has fewer headers to utilize its real estate more effectively than before.

#### Known Limitations

- When using active laser beam channels, the CLI wallet should not be offline for over 24 hours.
- Once generated, do not offer the same offline address to multiple senders of payments.

#### Points to Mention

- Upon using Atomic Swaps with ETH, DAI, WBTC, and USDT, users will have to create an account on Infura.
- The sender of funds to a receiver's Public Offline Address might be able to know that those funds are later being used by the receiver. Beam wallet and Beam explorer do not expose such functionality, but it's possible to derive this information by analyzing the Blockchain.
