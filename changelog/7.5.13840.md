### Known Limitations:

- **CLI Wallet & Laser Beam Channels:** Ensure the CLI wallet remains online when using active laser beam channels; it should not be offline for over 24 hours to avoid disruptions.
  
- **Offline Address Usage:** Do not offer the same offline address to multiple senders of payments, as this can lead to complications and tracking issues.
  
- **DApp Store - Ubuntu 22+ Issue:** Users on Ubuntu 22 and newer versions might experience issues with loading app icons in the DApp Store. This is under investigation.

### Points to Mention:

- **Atomic Swaps Requirement:** For users intending to execute Atomic Swaps with ETH, DAI, WBTC, and USDT, it is necessary to create an account on Infura.
  
- **Public Offline Address Transparency:** Be aware that when sending funds to a receiver's Public Offline Address, the sender might deduce when those funds are subsequently used. This transparency aspect is crucial in understanding the privacy dynamics of Beam wallet transactions.
