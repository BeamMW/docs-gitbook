<sub>Saturday, May 11, 2023</sub>

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug that led to the creation of invalid blocks, resulting in a temporary halt in the generation of new blocks. Optimized block creation.

#### Known Limitations

- When using active laser beam channels, the CLI wallet should not be offline for over 24 hours.
- Once generated, do not offer the same offline address to multiple senders of payments.
- DApp Store - On Ubuntu 22+ apps list, icons may not load.

#### Points to Mention

- Upon using Atomic Swaps with ETH, DAI, WBTC, and USDT, users will have to create an account on Infura.
- The sender of funds to a receiver's Public Offline Address might be able to know that those funds are later being used by the receiver.
