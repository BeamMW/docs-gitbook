# Governance Evolution

#### **TL;DR** As stated from the get-go, while Beam started the project as a for-profit venture, the long-term goal always was to pass the control to Beam holders, the first step toward such decentralization was the non-profit Beam Foundation, next stage is the BeamX DAO

## **Beam Foundation**

**The Beam Foundation uses the funds allocated to the Beam DAO Treasury to continue developing and promoting the Beam protocol and advance the broader privacy-related agenda.**

The Beam Foundation is registered in Singapore as a Company Limited by Guarantee, the preferred method of writing a non-profit body in Singapore. Singapore is crypto-friendly, but also it is a truly global city, a place where East and West meet.

The Beam Foundation governs by a Board of up to seven members; the current Board, all of whom have supported Beam for a long time and have the project's best interests at heart. The four current board members are:
